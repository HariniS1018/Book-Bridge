App.js:-
1. import cors from "cors"; 
- CORS is like a pipe or bridge that allows your frontend (hosted on one domain) to safely communicate with your backend (hosted on another).
- Cross-origin Resource Sharing.

2. Express:-
- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js framework that helps you build web servers and APIs quickly and cleanly. 
- Think of it as a toolbox that gives you shortcuts for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.

3. import errorHandler:-
- Import this Handler in app.js and set app.use() but at the last, so error from any other routes will be handled by the Handler.
- When any error occurs, this function is called and appropriate logging, sending response, message will be handled.
- In Express, if any route or middleware throws an error (or calls next(error)), Express skips everything and looks for a function like this:
(err, req, res, next) => { ... }





4. import notFoundHandler:-
- Import this Handler in app.js and set app.use() but at the last, so no routes match the requested route, then this Handler is triggered and response.
- When any error occurs, this function is called and appropriate logging, sending response, message will be handled.
