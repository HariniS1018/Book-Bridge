1. Folders controllers, routers, models, services should be within Book-Bridge/Backend/.

2. move the following code to server.js (because server.js is the entry point)-> look for this file in my branch.
    sequelize.authenticate()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connected!");
    return sequelize.sync({ alter: true });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("All models synced!");
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error("DB Error:", err);
  });

3. define associations (you could refer to the association relationships between tables in db.pdf under the heading `business logic`.)

4. rename or move init/db.js to db/sequelize.js

5. why importing models/index.js in app.js?

6. Thanks for examples to know how to use this sequelize. Got it in controllers.

7. in the following set of codes, remove created_at field and set timestamps to true.
    created_at: {
      type: DataTypes.DATE,
      defaultValue: DataTypes.NOW,
    },
  }, {
    tableName: "users",
    timestamps: false,
  });
